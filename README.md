### Tools:
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Project Motivation <a name="project-motivation"></a>
This project aims to analyze and visualize population data using Python. It focuses on filtering and aggregating population data based on different criteria, such as entity, municipality, locality, and ageb. The resulting data is then visualized in the form of a bar graph using Plotly Express.

## File Descriptions <a name="file-descriptions"></a>
- `population_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data retrieval, cleaning, filtering, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and its usage.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the code in `population_analysis.ipynb`, you need to have the required libraries installed. The Jupyter Notebook can be run cell by cell, following the provided code and comments.

Ensure you have the necessary database connection details (host, database name, port, user, password) to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database. Update the connection details in the code before executing the query.

The `grafica_censo_filtrado_region` function can be used to generate a bar graph of filtered population data. Provide the desired filter arguments (entity, municipality, locality, ageb) to customize the graph according to your requirements.
